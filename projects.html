            <h4>Goal Intellij Plugin</h4>

            <a>
                This plugin for intellij was inspired by a plugin for the GOAL lanuage which only 
                supported Eclipse, unfortionatly during our project where we were working on a Starcraft I bot
                Eclipse and the plugin crashed very often and therefore frustration arose amongst many students.
            </a> 
            <br>
            <a>
                After the project was finished I started my honours research in this field and worked with GOAL often. 
                This gave me the potential to create this plugin, partually because my research depended upon it but also 
                to give next years students an easier live during the project as they will be able to also use intellij 
                instead of Eclipse.
            </a>
